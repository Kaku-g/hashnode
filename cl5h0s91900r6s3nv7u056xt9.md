## Web Scraping with Puppeteer and Nodejs

Puppeteer is a nodejs library used to scrape data from website, automate browser's task and also for testing your app . Super easy to use.

**Installing Pupepeteer ->**

- Install Nodejs if not present.
-Run the following command in terminal

```
npm i puppeteer 
 //or
yarn add puppeteer
``` 
**Getting started->
**
-In this tutorial we will code an app for taking screenshot of the page!

-Create a basic template for nodejs.

```
npm init -y

``` 
- Create index.js in the root directory.
- Import puppeteer using 
```const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');
``` 
in index.js file


**Code for Index js **

```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

//async function as we are using await

(async () => {

 // launch your browser in background
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();

 // load a new page
  const page = await browser.newPage();

// go to url -> https://example.com
  await page.goto('https://example.com');

//take screenshot of the page 
//image will be saved in root directory
// with filename example.png
//will take screenshot of the page that is visible in browser's window
  await page.screenshot({path: 'example.png'});

// use this instead of above statement for full page screenshot
await page.screenshot({path: 'example.png',fullpage:'true'});

//for closing the browser
// tip-> always close browser after finishing all tasks
  await browser.close();
})();
``` 
- For avoiding any error always use try and catch inside the async function

```
try{
//code 
}
catch(error)
{
console.log(error);
}
``` 

- And finally for running your code use
```node index
``` 
in your terminal
