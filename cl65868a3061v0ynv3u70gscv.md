Header contains two parts

Payload contain claims which can be reserved,public,private.

Signature
for creating signature we take encoded header,encoded payload and sign that.

### How JWT works?

  An example
- when a user sends a post request to the server (like login), a JWT will be returned.
- the server will check for a valid JWT .
- if there is a valid JWT user will be allowed to access the protected page!

### Why use JWT?

-small in size
- more secured due to digital signature
- easier to process.
-stateless authentication (user is not saved in server memory)
- reduces need to go back and forth to database for information

### Common Use Cases :

-Authentication
-Authorization
-Information exchange
