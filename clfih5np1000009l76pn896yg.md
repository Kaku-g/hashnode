So I started exploring chrome extension , recently and came up with a cool extension to save your tabs.

Do your tabs get lost when you need them the most? As we don't always get the option to recover our tabs .

Want to shut down your pc and continue from where you left off ?

If the answer is yes , then Tabster is the only extension you need.

Tabster allows you to save your currently opened tabs, retrieve them, and arrange them according to the website!

The tabs can be retrieve even after closing the browser.

Download the extension from here :

[Get Tabster](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabster/epjkekcpjdffopichkinfjabbakeamhe?hl=en&authuser=0)

How to use the extension?
