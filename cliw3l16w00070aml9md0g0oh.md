# \[Md hoster\]: [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) Hackathon

### Description :

Do you have projects to showcase? but don't have a dedicated site for each one of them, then md-hoster is for you. Launch web app for your github repo ufrom markdown files(like README.md)

Markdown hoster lets you create a website from your GitHub repo instantly . Login using GitHub then enter the repo name and the path to the markdown file , hit submit and voila your webpage is up and running.

### Tech Stack

The app is divided into two parts backend and frontend. The backend uses node-app write SDK for integration with nodejs and the frontend uses React and Tailwind CSS.

[Frontend Repo](https://github.com/Kaku-g/mdhoster-frontend)

### Challenges Faced

Most of the tutorials shown in videos and blogs were using Appwrite's client API and not Node SDK. So it was challenging at first but after some time I managed to work around that. The backend provides Rest API for utilization in frontend app.

### Public Code Repo

The code is open-sourced on GitHub and you can visit the repo from here:
