## Is Linkedin Learning worth it ?

From the past few months I was curious to explore courses on  Linkedin Learning and
how are they different from other platforms.
 After purchasing the Linkedin Premium and going through its courses there are some of the points you should know before purchasing it.

**Pros**-

-> Its actually good for those who are
     
- Actively looking for jobs - It shows various statistics regarding  job posting and other 
   candidates who have applied.
- wants to connect with various people and cold email them (CEO's etc).
- someone who wants to build his personal brand.
- Some courses which  are new and updated are good (very few for devs)

**Cons**-
-> If you are someone who wants to buy it for Linkedin Learning courses and specially development or programming courses, then you might want to reconsider your decision.

- Most of the course material is old and outdated.
- User Interface is not that good.
- Courses are short compared to Udemy so you might have to switch back and forth 
    between various instructors for various topics.
- Subscription is costly ,specially if you are in for the courses only.
- Collection is really good on udemy with vast categories.

Also due to various course collection accessible instantly on Linkedin Learning ,one might get confused which courses to do.
I personally switched back and forth between different instructors and courses and was not able to focus on one.


**Note**- The review is solely based on my opinion , and others might not agree with it, and its totally cool !

**Tip**- Also if you really wanted to explore Linked Learning , you can access it on trial for 1 month for free , so you can get a better understanding of the platform and choose what's best for you.
